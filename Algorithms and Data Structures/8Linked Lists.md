# Linked Lists

---

# Motivation
- Simple application of pairs
- Building block for more complex data structures
  - Stacks
  - Queues
- Useful for considering issues in algorithm design:
  - Complexity and scaling
  - Iteration and recursion

# Definition
> A linked list is a sequential collection of data

# Operations
### **First**
- return the first element of the list  

### **Rest**
- return the list with the first element removed  

### **Cons[o]**
- return a new list whose first is o and whose rest is the list  

### **Set-first![o]**
- set the first of the list to o  

### **Set-rest![l]**
