# General

## Variable assignment
Variable assignment is indicated by the `<-` symbol:
 - eg. x `<-` 1

Variables in pseudocode do not need to be declared

### Vertical space
Statements separated by vertical space happen in sequence
 - x `<-` 1
 - y `<-` x
 - x `<-` 2

### Semicolons
Alternatively, semicolons separate statements in a sequence:
 - x `<-` 1; y `<-` x; x `<-` 2
