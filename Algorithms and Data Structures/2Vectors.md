# Vectors

# Motivation
- Useful abstraction of memory
- Basic building block

# Definition
> A vector is a finite fixed-size sequential collection of data

**Finite**
- a vector has a non-negative integer length

**Fixed-size**
- the length of the vector is immutable

**Sequential**
- a vector has a defined and static storage order of its elements

#Operations
**Length**
- return the number of elements in the vector
**Select[k]**
- return the kth element of the vector
**store![o,k]**
- set the kth element of the vector to o

In pseudocode:
```
length LENGTH(v)
select[k] v[k]
store![o,k] v[k] ‚Üê o
```

## Non-vector Operations
- delete!
- insert!
- resize!

## Implementation

*	Sentinel (C Strings)

	| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | $ |
	|---|---|---|---|---|---|

	*	**Iterates through string until the sentinel($)** to get the length

* 	length-data (everything else)

	| L | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
	|---|---|---|---|---|---|

	*	Read the **length slot(L)** to get the length.
