# Vectors

## Motivation
- Useful abstraction of memory
- Basic building block

## Definition
> A vector is a finite fixed-size sequential collection of data

*finite*
  - a vector has a non-negative integer length

*fixed-size*
  - the length of the vector is immutable

*sequential*
  - a vector has a defined and static storage order of its elements
